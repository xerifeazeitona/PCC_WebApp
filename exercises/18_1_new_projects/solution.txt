18-1. New Projects: To get a better idea of what Django does, build a couple of empty projects and look at what Django creates. Make a new folder with a simple name, like snap_gram or insta_chat (outside of your learning_log directory), navigate to that folder in a terminal, and create a virtual environment.
Install Django and run the command django-admin.py startproject snap_gram .
(make sure you include the dot at the end of the command).
Look at the files and folders this command creates, and compare them to Learning Log. Do this a few times until youâ€™re familiar with what Django creates when starting a new project. Then delete the project directories if you wish.

Solution:
mkdir snap_gram
cd snap_gram
python -m venv sg_env
source sg_env/bin/activate
pip install django
django-admin startproject snap_gram .
python manage.py migrate

After comparing contents, delete snap_gram with:
deactivate
cd ..
rm -rf snap_gram
